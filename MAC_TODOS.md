# MacOS Todo List

## Medium priority

- [ ] replace macbook hostname with real one.

## Low priority

- [ ] configure screen timeout to be same as on KDE
- [ ] remove spotlight categories
- clean up the justfile, devenv, and checks integrationƒ
- run "tv update-channels" on activation and install dependencies
- deal with nix eval warnings
- standardize hotkeys between mac and linux

- refactor nixos/darwin modules into shared modules where appropriate
  - create a mechanism to install packages with homebrew, flatpak, or nixpkgs as appropriate.
- look into lix auto-gc
- install rosetta?
- darwin tests
- [ ] Move configuration of mimetypes out of firefox.nix and standardize across mac/linux.
- setup linux builder so I can test my nixos config from macos (unfortunately not the other way around)
