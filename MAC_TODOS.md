- [ ] configure screen timeout to be same as on KDE
- [ ] replace macbook hostname with real one.
- [ ] remove spotlight categories
- run "tv update-channels" on activation and install dependencies
- deal with nix eval warnings
- ghostty transparency
- standardize hotkeys between mac and linux

- refactor nixos/darwin modules into shared modules where appropriate
  - create a mechanism to install packages with homebrew, flatpak, or nixpkgs as appropriate.
- look into lix auto-gc
