Create a comprehensive technical design for a GitHub issue with well-defined requirements. This command will:

1. Read the detailed requirements from the GitHub issue
2. Research existing codebase patterns and architecture
3. Design the technical solution and implementation approach
4. Create detailed implementation tasks and file structure
5. Identify dependencies and potential technical risks
6. Update the GitHub issue with technical design documentation

This focuses on HOW to build the solution, assuming requirements are already defined.

Best used after `/define` has clarified the requirements and scope.

Provide the GitHub issue number to create technical design for.
