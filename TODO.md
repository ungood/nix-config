* Prefer Projects with "Zero Configuration" philosophy and rust
* Choose:
    * Desktop Manager
    * Terminal (that supports Mac&Linux), low configuration
        * ghostty uses nix as their builder
        * wezterm is in rust
* Setup an AI agent to help write this package
* Clean up folder structure and imports (create lib function to importing of a directory)
* set users.mutableUsers to false (requires setting passwd!)
* automatic linting
* use unstable nix for desktops, stable for server
* configure numlock
* nix-direnv integration (or mise or something)
* some build system (justfile or mise)
* Better fonts
* Maybe neovim?
* Maybe tmux or zellig?
